## EIP 3074

2 years ago I was invited to Consensus to talk about the EIP 3074 and account abrastraction. I spent a few hours with my CTO Greg Markou to prepare a quick presentation for the Ethereum ecosystem panel.![Redwan - Consensus 22.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/_posts/Redwan - Consensus 22.jpg)

 
2 year later the proposal just was approved, what a better timing to share [that deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yQo23Si4tkXLnQq6SGw3ahTyw_yft0pZE8oZpG_bEdw/edit?usp=sharing).
