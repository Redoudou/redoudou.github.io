# Hello, I am Redwan

- French with algerian roots, I am based in Brooklyn since 2015. I work for [ChainSafe System](https://chainsafe.io/), leading research and development firm in the fields of Cryptography and Blockchain. I lead the  strategy of **Developer Tooling Program**.

## A little more about me
- I'm really interested in how technology, social impact and economic empowerement intersect. I think the new paradigms created by blockchain could change the way we work together as humans. I find a lot of inspiration in the work of Michel Bauwens (P2P Foundation) and Marcel Mauss. Respectively [The Common Economy](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Introduction_to_Commons_Economics) and [The gift](https://files.libcom.org/files/Mauss%20-%20The%20Gift.pdf).  
- I am a partner in my sister [Restaurant in France](https://ausanschichi.bzh/) since 2020 and nurture strong ties with the hospitality industry in NYC. 
- In my spare time, when I am not attending conferences or traveling, I mentor young french professionals in their [Web3 journey](https://app.myjobglasses.com)
