## A little more about me
I am particularly passionate about the intersection of technology and social impact, and how the new paradigms created by Blockchain can change the way humans work together. I am an avid reader of all the work of Michel Bauwens (P2P Foundation) and Marcel Mauss. Especially [The Common Economy](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Introduction_to_Commons_Economics). 
I am a partner in my sister [Restaurant in France](https://ausanschichi.bzh/) since 2020 and nurture strong ties with the hospitality industry in NYC. In my spare time, when I am not attending conferences or traveling, I mentor young french professionals in their [Web3 journey](https://app.myjobglasses.com)
