# Redwan Meslem

**Executive Director of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance** since January 2025. I lead the global organization positioning Ethereum as the institutional-grade standard for finance and industry.

I manage a board that includes Joe Lubin (ConsenSys), Paul Brody (EY), and other global technology leaders. I engage directly with CEOs, founders, and C-suite executives from Fortune 500s and high-growth enterprises to shape enterprise adoption strategy. I've represented Ethereum at the SEC Crypto Task Force and spoken at major conferences across 6+ countries.

Previously, I led the Developer Tooling Program at ChainSafe Systems, delivering projects for the Ethereum Foundation, Filecoin Foundation, Consensys, and other ecosystem leaders.

**16+ years** in program management across Web3, aerospace, investment banking, and hospitality.  
**French with Algerian roots**, based in Brooklyn since 2015.
