## A little more about me
I am particularly passionate about the intersection of technology and social impact, as how the new paradigms created by Blockchain can change the way humans work together. I am an avid reader of all the work of Michel Bauwens (P2P Foundation) and Marcel Mauss. Especially [The Common Economy](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Introduction_to_Commons_Economics). 
In my spare time when I am not attending conferences, I cook a lot, I love Calvados and cocktails.
