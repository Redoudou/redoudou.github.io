# Hello, I am Redwan

- Based in New York, I work for ChainSafe System, a leading **Crypto and Blockchain** research and development firm. I manage the consulting and R&D teams' delivery.
- I specialize in getting work done, from inception to delivery.

- I bring more than 15 years of experience in start-up sales development, program management, and **executive consulting services** in multiple industries from Investment Banking to Hospitality, with a focus on Blockchain cross-functional teams and global operations.

## Blockchain Journey
- In 2017, I bought my first Bitcoins out of curiosity, but only saw Blockchain as something for investment bankers.
- In 2019, I fell in love with Blockchain through the Blockchain for Social Impact Coalition in NYC.
- In 2020, the team I built won 1st place at the Blockchain for Social Impact Incubator with Lease On The Block.
- In 2021, I joined ChainSafe where I manage the consulting team and delivery for clients such as Filecoin, Ethereum Foundation, The Graph, in highly technical areas from Web3 Gaming to DeFi to Protocol R&D.

- April 2022, I transitioned into a managerial role where I have been responsible for building and mentoring a team of three senior technical project managers. I have taken the lead on various cross-company strategic projects, including the implementation of our capacity planning process, aligning it with our financial and organizational strategies. This initiative, overseen directly by the executive team, aims to enhance our company's overall delivery performance.

## A little more about me
I am particularly passionate about the intersection of technology and social impact, and how the new paradigms created by Blockchain can change the way humans work together. I am an avid reader of all the work of Michel Bauwens (P2P Foundation) and Marcel Mauss. Especially [The Common Economy](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Introduction_to_Commons_Economics). 
In my spare time, when I am not attending conferences or traveling, I cook and read a lot of press.
